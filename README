Our code depends on mpic++ library to compile. Makefile is present in src folder, which can be used to build
executable named ckympi.

This executable should be run using `mpirun` command with number of processes to be used as an argument. A sample
command would be :
`mpirun -np 10 ckympi`

Our codebase consists of following classes (all classes, except port.h, are written from the scratch):
1. ckympi.cpp
2. Grammar.cpp (+ header file)
3. Message.cpp (+ header file)
4. port.h (this file is used to ensure correct libraries are loaded into environment based on OS)
